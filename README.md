# Cryptocurrencies - Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Resources 
* Jupyter Notebook, Python, pandas library, hvplot, plotly, sklearn, PCA, KMeans
* Dataset: [crypto_data.csv](Resources/crypto_data.csv)
* Challenge Code: [crypto_clustering.ipynb](crypto_clustering.ipynb)

## Purpose
Accountability Accounting is looking to offer a brand new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for their customers. The purpose of this analysis was to create a report on the current cryptocurrencies trading market and how they could be grouped and classified for this new investment. 

## Deliverable 1 - Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* The following five preprocessing steps have been performed on the crypto_df DataFrame:
  * All cryptocurrencies that are not being traded are removed 
  * The IsTrading column is dropped 
  * All the rows that have at least one null value are removed 
  * All the rows that do not have coins being mined are removed 
  * The CoinName column is dropped 
* A new DataFrame is created that stores all cryptocurrency names from the CoinName column and retains the index from the crypto_df DataFrame 
* The get_dummies() method is used to create variables for the text features, which are then stored in a new DataFrame, X 
* The features from the X DataFrame have been standardized using the StandardScaler fit_transform() function 

## Deliverable 2 - Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* The PCA algorithm reduces the dimensions of the X DataFrame down to three principal components 
* The pcs_df DataFrame is created and has the following three columns, PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3, and has the index from the crypto_df DataFrame 

## Deliverable 3 - Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means 
* The K-means algorithm is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data, where the following steps have been completed:
  * An elbow curve is created using hvPlot to find the best value for K (10 pt)
  * Predictions are made on the K clusters of the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data (5 pt)
  * A new DataFrame is created with the same index as the crypto_df DataFrame and has the following columns: Algorithm, ProofType, TotalCoinsMined, TotalCoinSupply, PC 1, PC 2, PC 3, CoinName, and Class (5 pt)

## Deliverable 4 - Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
* The clusters are plotted using a 3D scatter plot, and each data point shows the CoinName and Algorithm on hover (10 pt)
* A table with tradable cryptocurrencies is created using the hvplot.table() function (3 pt)
* The total number of tradable cryptocurrencies is printed (2 pt)
* A DataFrame is created that contains the clustered_df DataFrame index, the scaled data, and the CoinName and Class columns (5 pt)
* A hvplot scatter plot is created where the X-axis is "TotalCoinsMined", the Y-axis is "TotalCoinSupply", the data is ordered by "Class", and it shows the CoinName when you hover over the data point (10 pt)
